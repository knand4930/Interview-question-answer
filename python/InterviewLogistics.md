## 👨‍🏫 For Interviewers

### ✅ Preparation Checklist

- **Review candidate's resume and GitHub profile thoroughly**  
  Understand their experience, tech stack, contributions, and areas of interest.

- **Prepare 3–4 questions from different difficulty levels**  
  Include warm-up, core skill, and advanced questions tailored to the role.

- **Have backup questions ready if candidate excels or struggles**  
  Use harder questions if excelling, easier if struggling.

- **Prepare realistic coding environment (IDE, whiteboard, etc.)**  
  Use tools matching your team’s workflow: CoderPad, VSCode, or physical whiteboard.

- **Plan time allocation for each section of the interview**  
  e.g., 5 mins intro, 25 mins coding, 15 mins design, 10 mins Q&A.

- **Prepare follow-up questions to dive deeper into responses**  
  Example: “Why did you choose this algorithm?” or “How would you scale this?”

- **Have evaluation criteria clearly defined before starting**  
  Use a rubric: code quality, problem-solving, communication, collaboration.

- **Prepare questions about the candidate's actual project experience**  
  Dig into specifics: “What was your role?”, “What challenges did you face?”

### 🕵️ During the Interview

- **Start with easier questions to build candidate confidence**  
  Reduces anxiety and builds rapport.

- **Allow thinking time and encourage talking through problems**  
  Prompt with: “Feel free to think aloud.”

- **Ask for clarification when answers are unclear**  
  Use follow-ups like: “Could you clarify that?”

- **Probe deeper on technologies mentioned in resume**  
  Example: “How did you use Kafka in that project?”

- **Observe problem-solving approach, not just final answers**  
  Focus on thought process, structure, and testing.

- **Take detailed notes for fair evaluation**  
  Helps with later comparison and feedback.

- **Ask about trade-offs and alternative approaches**  
  Encourage exploration of pros/cons.

- **Evaluate both technical skills and cultural fit**  
  Look for curiosity, teamwork, and openness to feedback.

### 🧾 Post-Interview

- **Complete evaluation form immediately while fresh**  
  Record impressions and scores right away.

- **Discuss with other interviewers to calibrate scoring**  
  Normalize perspectives to avoid bias.

- **Provide specific feedback examples for decisions**  
  Use real observations rather than vague statements.

- **Consider growth potential, not just current skills**  
  Evaluate coachability and attitude.

- **Factor in role requirements and team needs**  
  Match strengths with what’s needed now.

## 👩‍💻 For Candidates

### 📚 Preparation Tips

- **Practice coding problems on whiteboard, not just computer**  
  Simulates in-person/virtual whiteboarding.

- **Prepare specific examples from your actual project experience**  
  Use STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) format.

- **Review system design patterns and scalability concepts**  
  Understand load balancing, sharding, microservices, CAP, etc.

- **Practice explaining complex technical concepts simply**  
  Example: Explain caching to a junior dev.

- **Prepare thoughtful questions about the role and company**  
  Ask about tech stack, growth path, and team challenges.

- **Review recent projects and be ready to discuss challenges**  
  Share what went wrong and how you fixed it.

- **Practice discussing trade-offs and alternative solutions**  
  “I used X because it offered Y, despite downside Z.”

- **Prepare for both technical and behavioral questions**  
  Be ready for coding + soft skills scenarios.

### 🎤 During the Interview

- **Think out loud and explain your reasoning**  
  Show your thought process even if unsure.

- **Ask clarifying questions about requirements**  
  Example: “Should we handle invalid inputs?”

- **Start with simple solution, then optimize**  
  Brute force first, then refactor or scale.

- **Discuss trade-offs and alternative approaches**  
  Show depth by exploring more than one path.

- **Be honest about knowledge gaps**  
  Say: “I haven’t worked with that, but I’d approach it by…”

- **Show enthusiasm for learning and growth**  
  Express curiosity and willingness to improve.

- **Connect answers to real project experience**  
  Relate questions to actual problems you’ve solved.

- **Ask thoughtful questions about the team and challenges**  
  Engage in a two-way conversation about fit and goals.
